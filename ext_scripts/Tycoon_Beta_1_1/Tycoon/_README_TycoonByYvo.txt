Have fun!!!

1.1 Changelist:

- Fixed Tycoon for all non-english versions ( Such as Japanese, French, Chinese, Korean etc. Should work in all 3Ds Max versions )

- Fixed bug with selection still on using customPiece modifier. (While adding, direction, twisting and taper)

- Fixed alignment bug with non-watertight models / Planes for example.

- Rotating your custom mesh to work for the world Z axis is no longer necessary, simply rotate the pivot of your mesh into the direction you want to build and hit ADD+ It will also works if the custom mesh is rotated. You can now also flip the direction by changing the pivot to the other side and rotating it. (Should be automatic in a future update)

- Fixed rename: Tycoon will no longer rename your custom mesh.

- Disabled default undo, so Tycoon will no longer crash, maybe in a future update there will be some sort of undo/go back button.
